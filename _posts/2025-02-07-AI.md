# What is AI?

The synonym for **AI** is **Artificial Intelligence**. AI has become incredibly popular in recent years, particularly from 2023 to 2024.
Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. 
These systems can perform tasks such as recognizing speech, making decisions, and even creating content.

AI is used for a wide variety of applications, including writing articles, coding assistance, image generation, and much more. 
Modern AI models are trained on billions of parameters using powerful supercomputers. 
For instance, companies like [DeepSeek](https://deepseek.ai/) have developed more efficient training methods for AI models, which allow for better performance and reduced computational costs.[^1]

# Today's AI

Some of the most well-known AI models today include **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)** and **[DeepSeek](https://deepseek.ai/)**. 
ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is renowned for its ability to generate high-quality text and engage in natural conversations. 
DeepSeek, on the other hand, focuses on creating highly efficient and scalable AI models that can be applied across various industries.[^2]

# What I Am Using

Currently, I am using **[Qwen](https://chat.qwenlm.ai/)** and **[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)**. 
I primarily use Qwen because it offers more flexibility and is more cost-effective compared to ChatGPT. 
Qwen, developed by Alibaba Cloud, provides robust capabilities in generating text, understanding context, and assisting with various tasks. 
Its affordability and accessibility make it an attractive choice for many users who want to leverage AI without incurring high costs.[^3]

In summary, AI continues to evolve rapidly, offering new tools and opportunities for individuals and businesses alike. 
Whether you're using Qwen, ChatGPT, or other AI models, these technologies can significantly enhance productivity and creativity in numerous ways.
